# 🚀 Building a Smart Data Pipeline for Gans  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **automating data collection, transformation, and storage** for Gans, a **global e-scooter-sharing startup**. By leveraging **Google Cloud, MySQL Workbench, and API integrations**, this data pipeline aims to optimize **scooter availability, demand forecasting, and fleet management**.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
- **Data Collection via APIs & Web Scraping** – Aggregating location-based mobility insights.  
- **SQL Database Management** – Organizing and storing structured data for analysis.  
- **Cloud Automation (Google Cloud Functions & Scheduler)** – Streamlining real-time data processing.  
- **ETL Pipeline Development** – Extracting, transforming, and loading data for predictive modeling.  

## 📖 Project Description  
Gans competes with major players like **TIER and Bird**, aiming to improve operational efficiency beyond sustainability narratives. This pipeline helps **anticipate scooter movements**, addressing challenges like:  
✅ **Geographical mobility asymmetries** (e.g., users riding uphill, walking downhill).  
✅ **Commuting patterns** (e.g., morning flow from residential areas to city centers).  
✅ **Weather impact** (e.g., rain reducing scooter usage).  

By **automating data collection** and **optimizing fleet distribution**, Gans can enhance urban mobility solutions.  
## 🎯 Project Goals  
- **Develop a scalable, cloud-based data pipeline** for real-time insights.  
- **Ensure efficient storage and accessibility** in MySQL and GCP.  
- **Prepare data for future predictive modeling** to optimize scooter placements.
